# CASCADE Engine

## Developed by Droplet Studios
## Lead Programmer and Designer - Christopher Rice

### Description
The CASCADE Engine is a general purpose 2D/3D game engine. The purpose of this engine is to allow us to make simple games while at the same time learning the technology behind different game architecture fundamentals. This is a passion project for us and we hope that by updating it frequently we can share our learning with others for the benefit of the indie game development community. Feel free to clone the project and expand upon it in any way you see fit, just be sure to cite your sources as we will be doing the same here.
